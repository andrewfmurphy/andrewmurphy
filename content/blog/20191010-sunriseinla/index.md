There's a new feeling in Los Angeles.

Context

Warriors first quarter

Lebron James

Anthony Davis

Team composition

Supporting cast

Load management - injury risk

Rest of situation in the west

Hype, living up to expectations

What is the championship window for the lakers?

As the warriors showed, its hard to go back to back to back




Oh, and here's a great quote from this Wikipedia on
[salted duck eggs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salted_duck_egg).

> A salted duck egg is a Chinese preserved food product made by soaking duck
> eggs in brine, or packing each egg in damp, salted charcoal. In Asian
> supermarkets, these eggs are sometimes sold covered in a thick layer of salted
> charcoal paste. The eggs may also be sold with the salted paste removed,
> wrapped in plastic, and vacuum packed. From the salt curing process, the
> salted duck eggs have a briny aroma, a gelatin-like egg white and a
> firm-textured, round yolk that is bright orange-red in color.
