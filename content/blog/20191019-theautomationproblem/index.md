A few days ago, Paul Krugman wrote an opinion piece in the New York Times entitled <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/17/opinion/democrats-automation.html?rref=collection%2Fbyline%2Fpaul-krugman" target="_blank">"Democrats, Avoid the Robot Rabbit Hole"</a>, responding to a question asked at Tuesday night's Democratic Debate: How do we mitigate the looming threat of automation upon our workforce?

Krugman is eager to dismiss the problem of automation for more current and pressing causes of income inequality, pointing the finger at outsourcing and inadequate private spending. The impact of automation is simply a lightning rod that allows moderate Democrats to deflect on the harder issues behind income inequality while pretending to take a progressive stance. 

He even goes as far as to discount the issue of automation completely by saying that automation has been a part of society throughout all of modern history. The automation challenges we will face in the near future are no different than the problems automation posed to past generations. 

Let us not delude ourselves. Automation poses incredible problems for our labor force and for an economist as respected as Paul Krugman to say otherwise is irresponsible. While it is true that our society has always coexisted with technological revolution, the advancements of the next generation will truly be unprecedented in pace and scale. Attempting to use the slowing growth of <a href="https://www.bls.gov/lpc/" target="_blank">labor productivity</a> as evidence that automation is not to be worried about, Krugman is not far off from citing yesterday's low of 30&deg;F as evidence that climate change is a hoax.

Perhaps the industry that threatens to be disrupted the most by automation is transportation and logistics. As a case study, Uber is the ubiquitous rideshare app whose name has become synonymous with convenience and availability. In 2017, Uber reported having over 750,000 drivers in the United States alone, which would make them the second-largest domestic employer behind Walmart. But Uber has never seen a profit (aside from a one-time profit in 2018 from selling the Southeast Asia division of their business), and will most likely never be profitable as long as human drivers continue to comprise the bulk of their transportation network. 

Although research on automated driving amounts to just $450 million of their $11 billion in revenue, this portion of spending is the most crucial for Uber. Already doing road tests under the watchful eye of human drivers, it will not be long until they are fully ready to go. After spending just a few days as a delivery app courier, Andy Newman of the New York Times remarked: "Couriers’ real value to the app companies is in the data harvested like pollen as we make our rounds, data that will allow them to eventually replace us with machines." Uber's entire business model relies upon putting its entire fleet of drivers out of work, not as a matter of if but when. Until then, they are comfortable to sit back and collect our data, so when they do deploy their autonomous vehicles, they will do so with brutal efficiency.

The main way our society adapted to automation and technological advancement in the past is through a general increase in education level and a transition to more skilled jobs. The problem now is that America's higher education pipeline is saturated. For the first time ever, more than 90% of Americans now hold a high school diploma, and over a third of Americans now hold at least a bachelor's degree. <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/hsgec.nr0.htm" target="_blank">70%</a> of high school graduates enroll in college upon graduation, and while only <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/03/13/681621047/college-completion-rates-are-up-but-the-numbers-will-still-surprise-you" target="_blank">58%</a> of these students will complete a bachelor's degree within 6 years, these numbers combine to represent the largest portion of high school and college graduates ever.

As the college degree goes the way of the high school diploma, the signal of a college degree and the value that it carries are becoming somewhat diminished. At the same time, the cost of tuition continues to increase. No longer can we solve our problems by saying, "We need to increase the percentage of college-educated Americans". Those who are capable of financing a college education are probably already going to college. For those who are on the fence, going to college is becoming a worse financial decision. And finally, not everyone possesses the aptitude for higher education. There are already systems in place to identify disadvantaged students that will succeed at the next level including admissions' bias for first-generation college students and scholarship programs for minorities and poor students. At some point, we must admit that society has exhausted most everyone that possesses the natural aptitude and desire to learn at a high level and then some.

Krugman, to his credit, is completely correct when he says that other factors are to blame for the increasing wage gap to this point. And it *is* true that society adapting to disruptive technology is a tale as old as the invention of the printing press. Where he fails to connect the dots is in realizing that disruptive technology has always contributed to the income gap. With every invention of technology comes those who use it to make their businesses that much more profitable. This iteration of technological advancement will exacerbate an already wide-open income gap, making the issue that much worse. The issue of automation is not the only issue that will test our economic system in the future. But when it arrives, it will arrive in force. To ignore it will be at society's peril.


<!--One of the less discussed parts of Tuesday’s Democratic debate was the exchange that took place over automation and how to deal with it. But it’s worth focusing on that exchange, because it was interesting — by which I mean depressing. CNN’s Erin Burnett, one of the moderators, asked a bad question, and the debaters by and large — with the perhaps surprising exception of Bernie Sanders — gave pretty bad answers.

So let me make a plea to the Democrats: Please don’t go down the robot rabbit hole.

Burnett declared that a recent study shows that “about a quarter of U.S. jobs could be lost to automation in just the next 10 years.” What the study actually says is less alarming: It finds that a quarter of U.S. jobs will face “high exposure to automation over the next several decades.” 

But if you think even that sounds bad, ask yourself the following question: When, in modern history, has something like that statement not been true?

After all, in the late 1940s America had about seven million farmers and around 12 million production workers in manufacturing. Machinery could and did take over much of the work those Americans were doing — and people at the time wondered where the new jobs would come from. If you think that concerns about automation are somehow new, bear in mind that Kurt Vonnegut’s novel “Player Piano,” envisioning a dystopian future in which machines have taken away all the jobs, was published in … 1952.

Yet the generation that followed was a golden age for American workers, who saw dramatic increases in their income, with many entering a rapidly growing middle class.

You might say that this time is different, because the pace of technological change is so much faster. But that’s not what the data say. On the contrary, worker productivity — which is how we measure the extent to which workers are being replaced by machines — has lately been growing much more slowly than in the past; it rose less than half as much from 2007 to 2018 as it did over the previous 11 years.

Which makes you wonder what Andrew Yang is talking about. Yang has based his whole campaign on the premise that automation is destroying jobs en masse and that the answer is to give everyone a stipend — one that would fall far short of what decent jobs pay. As far as I can tell, he’s offering an inadequate solution to an imaginary problem, which is in a way kind of impressive.

Let me also give a shout-out to Joe Biden, who echoed Yang’s talk about a “fourth industrial revolution.” More on that in a minute.

[For an even deeper look at what’s on Paul Krugman’s mind, sign up for his weekly newsletter.]

Elizabeth Warren questioned Burnett’s premise, saying that the principal reason we’re losing jobs is trade policy that has encouraged jobs to move overseas. This claim was slammed by the fact-checkers at The Associated Press, who declared that automation was the “primary culprit” in manufacturing job loss between 2000 and 2010. As it happens, Warren was more right than the supposed fact-checkers; reasonable estimates say that trade was responsible for a large share of manufacturing job loss in the decade before the Great Recession.

Warren was surely wrong to suggest, however, that changing trade policy would do much to bring good jobs back. She got onto much sounder footing when she moved on to her wider agenda of tackling inequality and the power of the wealthy.

The best answer, as I said, came from Sanders. No, I don’t support his proposed job guarantee, which probably isn’t workable. But he was right to say that there’s plenty of work to do in America, and right to call for large-scale public investment, which even mainstream economists have been advocating as a response to persistent economic weakness.

Why? Because the persistent weakness — yes, we have low unemployment at the moment, but thanks only to extremely low interest rates, and we’re very poorly prepared for the next recession — isn’t about automation; it’s about inadequate private spending.

So what’s with the fixation on automation? It may be inevitable that many tech guys like Yang believe that what they and their friends are doing is epochal, unprecedented and changes everything, even if history begs to differ. But more broadly, as I’ve argued in the past, for a significant part of the political and media establishment, robot-talk — i.e., technological determinism — is in effect a diversionary tactic.

That is, blaming robots for our problems is both an easy way to sound trendy and forward-looking (hence Biden talking about the fourth industrial revolution) and an excuse for not supporting policies that would address the real causes of weak growth and soaring inequality.

So harping on the dangers of automation, while it may sound tough-minded, is in practice a sort of escapist fantasy for centrists who don’t want to confront truly hard questions. And progressives like Warren and Sanders who reject technological determinism and face up to the political roots of our problems are, on this issue at least, the actual hardheaded realists in the room.

Other Democrats should follow their lead. They should focus on the real issues, and not get sidetracked by the pseudo-issue of automation.
